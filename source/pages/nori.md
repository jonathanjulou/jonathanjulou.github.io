For the project, I modified the Nori codebase to add octree raytracing, various sampling methods, materials and integrators, up to multi-importance sampling.

In addition, student had to add some extensions. I added textures, bump mapping and alpha hashing.


For the final competition, students had to set up a scene and render it with their path-tracer.
I sculpted my scene in Blender, using free textures from textures.com, and reusing the humanoid model I made for the Pix'Art film, which had a clean topology and was already rigged.
Since I could not add participating media in time, the volumes are done with a succession of alpha-hashed planes and some subsurface scattering is painted directly on the character's texture.


My final render for the competition:
